Raku package for association rule learning.

This repository has the code of a Raku package for
[Association Rule Learning (ARL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning)
functions, [Wk1].

ARL framework includes the algorithms 
[Apriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm) 
and 
[Eclat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Eclat_algorithm), 
and the measures 
[confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Confidence),
[lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Lift), and 
[conviction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Conviction).

For computational introduction to ARL utilization (in Mathematica) see the article
["Movie genre associations"](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/movie-genre-associations/),
[AA1].

The examples below use the packages
["Data::Generators"](https://raku.land/cpan:ANTONOV/Data::Generators),
["Data::Reshapers"](https://raku.land/cpan:ANTONOV/Data::Reshapers), and
["Data::Summarizers"](https://raku.land/cpan:ANTONOV/Data::Summarizers), described in the article
["Introduction to data wrangling with Raku"](https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2021/12/31/introduction-to-data-wrangling-with-raku/),

## Installation

Via zef-ecosystem:

```shell
zef install ML::AssociationRuleLearning
```

From GitHub:

```shell
zef install https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-ML-AssociationRuleLearning
```

-------

## Frequent sets finding 

Here we get the Titanic dataset (from "Data::Reshapers") and summarize it:

```perl6
use Data::Reshapers;
use Data::Summarizers;
my @dsTitanic = get-titanic-dataset();
records-summary(@dsTitanic);
```

**Problem:** Find all combinations values of the variables "passengerAge", "passengerClass", "passengerSex", and
"passengerSurvival" that appear more 200 times in the Titanic dataset.

Here is how we use Eclat's implementation to give an answer:

```perl6
use ML::AssociationRuleLearning;
my @freqSets = eclat(@dsTitanic, min-support => 200, min-number-of-items => 2, max-number-of-items => Inf):counts;
@freqSets.elems
```

The function `eclat` returns the frequent sets together with their support.

Here we tabulate the result:

```perl6
say to-pretty-table(@freqSets.map({ %( Frequent-set => $_.key.join(' '), Support => $_.value) }), align => 'l');
```

We can verify the result by looking into these group counts, [AA2]:

```perl6
my $obj = group-by( @dsTitanic, <passengerClass passengerSex>);
.say for $obj>>.elems.grep({ $_.value >= 200 });
$obj = group-by( @dsTitanic, <passengerClass passengerSurvival passengerSex>);
.say for $obj>>.elems.grep({ $_.value >= 200 });
```

**Remark:** For datasets -- i.e. arrays of hashes -- `eclat` preprocess the data by concatenating
column names with corresponding column values. This done in order to prevent "collisions" from of same values from
different columns. If that concatenation is not desired manual preprocessing like this can be used:

```perl6
@dsTitanic.map({ $_.values.List }).Array
```

**Remark:** `elcat`'s argument `min-support` can take both integers greater than 1 and frequencies between 0 and 1.
(If an integer greater than one is given, then the corresponding frequency is derived.)

-------

## Association rules finding

Here we find association rules with min support 0.3 and min confidence 0.7:

```perl6
association-rules(@dsTitanic, min-support => 0.3, min-confidence => 0.7)
==> to-pretty-table
```

### Reusing found frequent sets

The function `eclat` takes the adverb ":object" that makes `eclat` return an object of type
`ML::AssociationRuleLearning::Eclat`, which can be "pipelined" to find association rules.

Here we find frequent sets, return the corresponding object, and retrieve the result:

```perl6
my $eclatObj = eclat(@dsTitanic.map({ $_.values.List }).Array, min-support => 0.12, min-number-of-items => 2, max-number-of-items => 6):object;
$eclatObj.result.elems
```

Here we find association rules and pretty-print them:

```perl6
$eclatObj.find-rules(min-confidence=>0.7)
==> to-pretty-table 
```

**Remark:** Note that because of the specified min confidence, the number of association rules is "contained" --
a (much) larger number of rules would be produced with, say, `min-confidence=>0.2`.

## Implementation considerations

### UML diagram

Here is an UML diagram that shows package's structure:

![](./resources/class-diagram.png)


The
[PlantUML spec](./resources/class-diagram.puml)
and
[diagram](./resources/class-diagram.png)
were obtained with the CLI script `to-uml-spec` of the package "UML::Translators", [AAp6].

Here we get the [PlantUML spec](./resources/class-diagram.puml):

```shell
to-uml-spec ML::AssociationRuleLearning > ./resources/class-diagram.puml
```

Here get the [diagram](./resources/class-diagram.png):

```shell
to-uml-spec ML::AssociationRuleLearning | java -jar ~/PlantUML/plantuml-1.2022.5.jar -pipe > ./resources/class-diagram.png
```

### Eclat

Eclat is based on Raku's 
[sets, bags, and mixes](https://docs.raku.org/language/setbagmix)
functionalities.

Eclat represents the transactions as a hash of sets:

- The keys of the hash are items

- The elements of the sets are transaction identifiers.

(In other words, for each item and inverse index is made.)

This representation allows for quick calculation of item combinations support.

We can say the Eclat uses a "vertical database representation" of the transactions.

### Apriori 

Apriori uses the standard, horizontal database transactions representation.

We can say that Apriori:

- Generates candidates for item frequent sets using the routine 
  [`combinations`](https://docs.raku.org/routine/combinations)

- Filters candidates by 
  [Tries with frequencies](https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-ML-TriesWithFrequencies) 
  creation and removal by threshold

Apriori is usually (much) slower than Eclat. 
Historically, Apriori is the first ARL method, and its implementation in the package is didactic.

### Association rules

We can say that the association rule finding function is a general, but that function
does require fast computation of confidence, lift, etc. Hence Eclat's transactions representation
is used.

Association rules finding with Apriori is the same as with Eclat. 
The package function `assocition-rules` with `method=>'Apriori`
simply sends Apriori found frequent sets to the Eclat based association rule finding.
